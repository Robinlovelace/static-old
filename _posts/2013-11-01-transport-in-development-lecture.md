The slideshow below provides an outline of the lecture I've been asked 
to do at the University of Birmingham. To put this in context, I've
been heavily involved with [Engineers Without Borders](http://www.ewb-uk.org/).
I joined [EWB Sheffield](https://ewb.shef.ac.uk/) when I moved there and 
was on the committe for
the past 4 years. My job was a project manager, first for the wind 
turbine project, and then for pedal powered machines group, which [lives
on](https://www.facebook.com/groups/363796170375539/).
My main involvement now is with the "[EinD](http://engineeringindevelopment.org/)"
project, co-writing a chapter on 
transport in development. And so I was invited to do this talk, 
which is part of a push by Birmingham and other Engineering departments
to engage more closely with issues of poverty, sustainability and 
ethics. I think this is a fantastic idea as todays engineers will  
quite literally help build tomorrow's world.
