Today I'm presenting some work I've been doing on *spatial microsimulation* to
the [University of Wollongong](http://smartuow.com/events/UOW186227.html),
who are hosting me for the day. A flyer for the event can be found
[here](http://smartuow.com/content/groups/public/@web/@smart/documents/doc/uow186229.pdf)
and my [slides](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/53973) are up online.
