This course is about getting to grips with the basics of the R command line
for basic data analysis and visualisation. There's a focus on maps and ggplot2.

The first part of the course uses Rich Harris's "Short Introduction to R" 
([here](http://www.social-statistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/intro_to_R1.pdf)).

The second part works through an "Introduction to Spatial Data and ggplot2" ([Cheshire
and Lovelace, 2013](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/blob/master/intro-spatial-rl.pdf)),
which can be found on an updated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R)
or as an [RPubs document](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/intro-spatial).

All the data for this second practical can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0z9a0hrn72poql5/Bx3rgWZ0kN .
