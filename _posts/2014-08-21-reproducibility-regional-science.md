Today I presented my talk at the [RSAI British and Irish Section](http://www.rsai-bis.org/).
The talk is about reproducibility. Why are reproducible methods and results
important? How reproducible is Regional Science? What can be done to increase
the reproducibility of your work? These are the types of questions tackled in
the talk, which also be seen on the [Rpubs website](http://rpubs.com/robinlovelace/25365).
