title: Daily GPS data to study exploration of a new city
categories: ideas

The inspiration for this idea came one night in Sheffield, dreaming of my move to Leeds. How would I fit-in to my new surroundings? How long would it take to adapt? What would I do? and, crucially for this idea, where would I go?

With these thoughts bouncing around in my head, keeping me awake, the following plan was devised:

- Keep the GPS on at all times
- Save the waypoints periodically in a continuous track using Orux or another map service
- Upload the data periodically to map-out my discovery of a new city

This ideas would be fun but could also be useful: it could inform about 'spatial bias' and flag unexplored places. It also has big visualisation potential, both static and dynamic. Most grandly, making the dataset open source and free to anyone, it could potentially be used as a testbed by researchers interested in human behaviour in the city. 

Will this plan ever become reality? I hope so - will need to remember to charge my second-hand Galaxy S2 nightly for it to work!
