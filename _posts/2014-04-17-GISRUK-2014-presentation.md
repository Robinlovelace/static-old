These are my presentation slides for the Geographic Information System
Research UK conference (aka GISRUK) held this year in
[Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/conferences/gisruk/).
The talk discusses the potential and pitfalls of the growth
in 'Big Data' in geographic research and seeks to open up
the debate on the situations when such information is more,
or less, useful for improving our understanding of the world.
Check the final slides for follow-ups on this.
