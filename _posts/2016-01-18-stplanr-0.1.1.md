Version 0.1.1 of the package
[stplanr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/) has been
released on CRAN. This is a major update with many new functions and a
new class definition, `SpatialLinesNetwork`, for route planning and
network analysis using
[igraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html).

This short post, by myself and package co-author [Richard
Ellison](http://sydney.edu.au/business/itls/staff/richarde), describes
how stplanr can be used for transport research with a few simple
examples from the package documentation. We hope that stplanr is of use
to transport researchers and practitioners worldwide and encourage
contributions to the development version hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr).

Working with origin-destination data
------------------------------------

Origin-destination (OD) data is one of the basic data sources for
understanding travel behaviour. Usually OD data in R is represented by a
table containing at least the following columns:

-   Origin ID: a text string identifying the zone in which journeys
    originate
-   Destination ID: a test string identifying the destination zone
-   Number of trips: the rate of travel between the unique OD pair

Additional columns can provide a break-down by trip type such as by mode
of travel (e.g. car) and time of day. A sample of this data (also
referred to as 'Flow data' by some statistical organsiations) is
provided in the example dataset `flows`, as illustrated in the Table
below.

    library(stplanr)

    ## Loading required package: sp

    library(tmap)

To link this data to geographical space we use a dataset stored as a
`SpatialPointsDataFrame` from the sp package in `cents`:

    data(cents)
    plot(cents)

![](http://robinlovelace.net/figure/2016-01-18-stplanr-0.1.1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)  
 To link the flow data we can use the command `od2line()` to create
`SpatialLinesDataFrame`:

    odlines <- od2line(flow = flow, zones = cents)
    plot(cents)
    plot(odlines, add = TRUE)

![](http://robinlovelace.net/figure/2016-01-18-stplanr-0.1.1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)  
 Note that the function also accepts a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` as an
input by setting the line start and end point to the zone's geographic
centroid:

    odlines <- od2line(flow = flow, zones = zones)
    plot(zones)
    plot(odlines, add = TRUE)

![](http://robinlovelace.net/figure/2016-01-18-stplanr-0.1.1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)  
 To gain a basic understanding of the rate of travel in this simple
travel system, we can plot the `odlines` with width proportional to the
number of people travelling:

    plot(odlines, lwd = odlines$All / mean(odlines$All) * 3, col = "red")
    plot(odlines, lwd = odlines$On.foot / mean(odlines$All) * 3, col = "green", add = T)

![](http://robinlovelace.net/figure/2016-01-18-stplanr-0.1.1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)  
 In the resulting plot the total rate of travel is represented by the
width of red lines. The proportion of people who walk is illustrated by
the relationship between the width of the green and red lines. We can
use this data to explore the relationship between walking and distance:

    odlines <- spTransform(odlines, CRS("+init=epsg:27700"))
    odlines$dist <- rgeos::gLength(odlines, byid = T)
    plot(odlines$dist, odlines$On.foot / odlines$All)

    # fit a model to the curve
    m <- lm(On.foot / All ~ dist, odlines@data)
    lines(odlines$dist, m$fitted.values)

![](http://robinlovelace.net/figure/2016-01-18-stplanr-0.1.1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)  

    summary(m)

    ##

    ## lm(formula = On.foot/All ~ dist, data = odlines@data)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:

    ## dist        -1.409e-04  2.501e-05  -5.633 9.64e-07 ***

    ## F-statistic: 31.73 on 1 and 47 DF,  p-value: 9.638e-07

This is useful information: we can see a clear negative relationship
between the distance of the trip (in metres) and the proportion who are
willing to make the journey on foot.

Working with route-allocated 'flow' data
----------------------------------------

stplanr includes functions for allocating OD pairs to the transport
network, including `route_cyclestreet()`, `route_graphhopper()` and,
most rececently `viaroute()` which provides an R interface to the
superfast [OSRM routing
API](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Server-api). This
is useful because roads rarely take you directly from origin to
destination, as illustrated below for the trip from Leeds to London one could
take to to
attend the upcoming [GISRUK
conference](http://www.gre.ac.uk/ach/services/events/gisruk2016/home):

    route <- route_cyclestreet("Leeds", "Greenwich")
    library(tmap)
    tiles <- read_osm(bb(route, ext = 2))
    tm_shape(tiles) +
      tm_raster() +
      tm_shape(route) +
      tm_lines()

![](http://robinlovelace.net/figure/2016-01-18-stplanr-0.1.1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)  
 We can allocate all of the OD pairs in `odlines` to the transport
network using these functions. The `routes_fast` dataset, for example,
was created using `line2route()` and represents the rastest route that a
cyclist may take, according to the [CycleStreets.net
API](http://www.cyclestreets.net/api/). A sample of this dataset is
illustrated below:

    routes_fast$weight <- c(5, 10)
    plot(routes_fast[1:2,], lwd = routes_fast$weight)

![](http://robinlovelace.net/figure/2016-01-18-stplanr-0.1.1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)  
 Note that there is some overlap between the two lines above. It is
sometimes useful to take aggregate statistics for the attributes of
overlapping lines, for example to estimate the number of people using
any particular part of the transport network. This can be acheived using
[Barry
Rowlingson's](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/139681/overlaying-lines-and-aggregating-their-values-for-overlapping-segments)
function `overline()`:

    rnet <- overline(routes_fast[1:2,], attrib = "weight", fun = sum)

Note that in the above plot the final segment to the east has a `weight`
value that is the sum of the two overlapping lines in
`routes_fast[1:2,]`: 5 + 10 = 15. We can verify this with Barry's neat
function

    plot(rnet, lwd = rnet$weight, col = "red")
    lineLabels(rnet, "weight")

![](http://robinlovelace.net/figure/2016-01-18-stplanr-0.1.1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)  
 \#\# Other functions

There are many other functions designed to help transport researchers in
`stplanr`. These include:

-   `read_stats19*` functions which import and format UK 'Stats19' road
    traffic casualty data
-   `calc_catchment*` functions for calculating transport 'catchment
    areas' using buffers around transport facilities
-   `gtfs2sldf()` for reading-in Google's
    [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/?hl=en) format
    into R
-   `toptail*` functions for removing the beginning and ends of
    `SpatialLines` objects

The use of the `calc_catchment*` functions can be illustrated using some
simple data from Sydney showing the potential catchment of a possible
separated cycle paths. First we import the data that we want to use:

    library(rgdal)

    ## rgdal: version: 1.1-3, (SVN revision 594)
    ##  Geospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded
    ##  Loaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 1.11.2, released 2015/02/10
    ##  Path to GDAL shared files: /usr/share/gdal/1.11
    ##  Loaded PROJ.4 runtime: Rel. 4.8.0, 6 March 2012, [PJ_VERSION: 480]
    ##  Path to PROJ.4 shared files: (autodetected)
    ##  Linking to sp version: 1.2-2

    data_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "stplanr")
    unzip(file.path(data_dir, 'smallsa1.zip'))
    unzip(file.path(data_dir, 'testcycleway.zip'))
    sa1income <- readOGR(".","smallsa1") # Import some population data

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: ".", layer: "smallsa1"
    ## with 638 features
    ## It has 19 fields

    testcycleway <- readOGR(".","testcycleway") # Import the path of the cycleways to test

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: ".", layer: "testcycleway"
    ## with 2 features
    ## It has 2 fields

We can then use our population data and the path of the cycleways to
estimate the population catchment for a given distance. If our
population layer contains fields with multiple subsets of data for which
we want to calculate the catchment area (e.g., men, women and children),
we can calculate the individual catchments. For this example, we will
simply use the 'Total' field containing the total population:

    cycle_catchment <- calc_catchment(
      polygonlayer = sa1income, # The SpatialPolygonsDataFrame containing the population data
      targetlayer = testcycleway, # The Spatial* object containing the transport infrastructure of interest
      calccols = c('Total'), # The columns to summarise
      distance = 500, # The desired distance,
      projection = 'austalbers', # The projection to use for calculating the area
      dissolve = TRUE # Collapse all the population zones into a single polygon for the catchment
    )
    cycle_catchment$Total # Print the total catchment population

    ## [1] 23944.32

We can also plot the catchment area and the cycle paths. You will notice
that in this example, there are gaps in the buffers. These gaps are
because of the gaps in the population layer where Sydney harbour passes
through the area. To take into account the road network and not simply
straight-line distance, we can use the `calc_network_catchment`
function.

    plot(cycle_catchment)
    plot(testcycleway, col="red", add=TRUE, lwd=2)

![](http://robinlovelace.net/figure/2016-01-18-stplanr-0.1.1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)  
 The toptail functionality is useful for removing the beginning and ends
of SpatialLines, both for improving aestetchics of plots and for
ensuring that lines do not overlap. This functionality is illustrated
below using the `routes_fast` data.

    proj4string(routes_fast) <- CRS("+init=epsg:4326")
    rf_toptailed <- toptail(routes_fast, toptail_dist = 300)
    plot(routes_fast, col = "red", lwd = 5)
    plot(rf_toptailed, add = T)

 The package
[vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/introducing-stplanr.html)
contains some further illustrations of `stplanr`'s functions which we
plan to improve on over time. While become almost 'industry standard' in
fields such as diverse as [genetics, astronomy and
epidemiology](http://www.nature.com/news/programming-tools-adventures-with-r-1.16609),
R has received limited attention in transport planning. We believe that
there is great potential for R, via new packages such as stplanr, to
help solve real world transport problems such as [estimating the
geographical distribution of cycling
potential](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04425).

The 'sustainable' in the package name relates to the emphasis on
low-carbon modes in the package such as cycling and public transport.
There is a huge amount of work to be done to plan for a transition away
from fossil fuels in the sector, for
[health](http://www.bma.org.uk/transport) and
[environmental](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692314001586)
reasons. In this context we hope that software such as `stplanr`
contributes to the evidence base needed to design better transport
systems.
