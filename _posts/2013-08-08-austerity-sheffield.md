Here's a little post about Austerity Sheffield, a new site about the impact of the spending cuts in South Yorkshire. You can find the website [here](http://jus.shef.ac.uk/mawebdissertations2013/austerity-sheffield/).

The latest story is on McKenzie Friends, volunteers who help people in court with no legal representation. Check it out [here](http://jus.shef.ac.uk/mawebdissertations2013/austerity-sheffield/mckenzie-friends-legal-assistance-for/)!
