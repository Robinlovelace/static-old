This is a presentation I gave to the [Geography Department](http://www.udg.edu/depgeo/Inici/tabid/13631/language/ca-ES/Default.aspx) 
at the University of Girona. It includes some insights into my academic research and my take on geography that I've never 
had the chance to put on paper. So please check it out if you are, like me, interested in Geography, energy and the future of 
humans on Earth. The slides are can be downloaded from the speaker deck website so click on the link if you want to 
download the pdf and access the links contained within. Just hitting the soundcloud button below should make the audio
