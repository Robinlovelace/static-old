Below are the slides of a talk on modelling the energy and emissions savings offered by increased cycling. This is for a seminar on [Cycling and Transport Modelling](http://modellingonthemove.org/events/modelling-on-the-move-6-cycling-transport-modelling/). The full `ppt` file of this talk can be found on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h7amogrzmbyzjzn/Energy-use-carbon.ppt). This [briefing document](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/energy-cycling/blob/master/ntm-dft-briefing.pdf?raw=true) about the Department for Transport's rather pessimistic National Transport Model may also be of interest. Audio and additional materials from the talk to be uploaded in due course.
