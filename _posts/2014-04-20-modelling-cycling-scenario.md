These are the slides of a presentation I am doing
today for the [E-Futures Doctoral Training
Centre](http://e-futures.group.shef.ac.uk/page/home/)
in Sheffield. This is where I developed my interest in transport and energy and
where I learned many of my research skills so it's a return-home talk for me.
The links in the presentation are almost as interesting as the presentation
itself (for me at least) so please feel free to download and share the slides.
