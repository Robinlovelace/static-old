Here's my recently published review of the [Sage Handbook of Transport
Studies](http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book234882). No need to go into details here: it's a solid overview book that
provides a useful introduction to this emerging field. The title of my [Amazon
review](http://www.amazon.co.uk/SAGE-Handbook-Transport-Studies-Handbooks/dp/1849207895/ref=cm_aya_orig_subj) sums up
my thoughts on it: "Comprehensive overview but bland at times".

For a more detailed review, please see my write-up on the [Transport Geography Research Group
website](http://tgrg.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/new-transport-studies-handbook-a-review/), which
hosts a [pdf version of the full review](https://tgrg.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/lovelace-2014-sage-handbook-of-transport-studies-jean-paul-rodrigue-theo-notteboom-jon-shaw-eds-sage-london-2013-c2a395-ha.pdf), [published in the Journal of Transport
