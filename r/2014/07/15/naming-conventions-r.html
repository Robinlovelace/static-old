    <h1 class="post-title">Consistent naming conventions in R</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Jul 15, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Naming conventions in R are famously anarchic, with no clear winner and multiple conventions in use <em>simultaneously</em> in the same package. This has been written about before, in a lucid article in the <a href="http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2012-2/RJournal_2012-2_Baaaath.pdf">R Journal</a>, a detailed exploration of names in R source code <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rockchalk/vignettes/Rstyle.pdf">hosted on CRAN</a> and general discussion on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1944910/what-is-your-preferred-style-for-naming-variables-in-r">stackoverflow</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, there are 5 naming conventions to choose from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>alllowercase: e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">adjustcolor</code></li>
  <li>period.separated: e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">plot.new</code></li>
  <li>underscore_separated: e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">numeric_version</code></li>
  <li>lowerCamelCase: e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">addTaskCallback</code></li>
  <li>UpperCamelCase: e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">SignatureMethod</code></li>
</ul>

<p>There are clear advantages to choosing one naming convention and sticking to it, regardless which one it is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Use common sense and BE CONSISTENT”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml">Google Style Guide</a> is ironically written in a rather inconsistent way (mixing capitals with lowercase in a single sentence surely breaks their own rule!)</p>

<p>But which one to choose? Read below to find out about the thorny issue
of naming conventions in R, based on a <a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/raw/master/intro-spatial-rl.pdf">tutorial on geo-spatial data handling
in R</a>.</p>

<h2 id="naming-convention-chaos">Naming convention chaos</h2>

<p>I recently encountered this question when I looked at the CRAN hosted version of the tutorial I co-authored ‘Introduction to visualising spatial data in R’. To my dismay, this document was littered with inconsistencies: here are just a few of the object names used, breaking almost every naming convention:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Partic_Per</code>: This variable is trying to be simultaneously UpperCamelBack and underscore_separated: a new naming convention I’d like to coin Upper_Underscore_Separated (joke). Here’s another example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Spatial_DistrictName</code> These styles should not be mixed according to <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html">Hadley Wickham</a> and <a href="http://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/r-style-guide/">Colin Gillespie</a>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">sport.wgs84</code>: An example of period.separation</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">crimeDat$MajorText</code>: lowerCamelBack and UpperCamelBack <em>in the same object</em>!</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ons_label</code>: a rare example of a consistent use of a naming convention, although this was in a variable name, not an object.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does any of your code look like this? If so I suggest sorting it out. Ironically, we had a section on typographic conventions <em>in the error strewn document</em>. This states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“it is a good idea to get into the habit of consistent and clear writing in any language, and R is no exception”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was time to follow our own advice!</p>

<h2 id="a-trigger-to-remedy-chaotic-code">A trigger to remedy chaotic code</h2>

<p>The tutorial was used as the basis for a <a href="http://foss4g-e.org/content/using-r-command-line-gis">workshop</a> delivered at the Free and Open Source Software for Geo-spatial (<a href="http://foss4g.org/">FOSS4G</a>) conference in <a href="http://foss4g-e.org/">Bremen</a>. The event is affiliated with the The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (<a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">OSGeo</a>), who are big advocates of consistency and <a href="http://live.osgeo.org/en/standards/standards.html">standards</a>. With many experienced programmers at the event, it was the perfect opportunity to update the tutorial on the project’s <a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R">github repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="which-naming-convention">Which naming convention?</h2>

<p>We decided to use the <strong>underscore_separated</strong> naming convention. Why? It wasn’t because we love typing underscores (which can cause problems in some contexts), but because of more fundamental issues with the other options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>alllowercase names are difficult to read, especially for non-native readers.</li>
  <li>period.separated names are confusing for users of <a href="http://python4astronomers.github.io/python/objects.html">Python</a> and other languages in which dots are meaningful.</li>
  <li>UpperCamelBack is <em>ugly</em> and requires excessive use of the shift button.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also a couple of reasons why we positively like underscores:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Underscores are <strong>fast</strong> to read: 10% to 20% faster than camelBack, which is especially confusing to non-native English readers, according to <a href="http://whathecode.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/camelcase-vs-underscores-scientific-showdown/">one article</a>.</li>
  <li>Underscores are recommended by some prominent R users, including <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html">Hadley Wickham</a>, <a href="http://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/r-style-guide/">Colin Gillespie</a> and <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2012/08/28/migrating-from-dot-to-underscore/">Andrew Gellman</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementing-a-consistent-coding-convention">Implementing a consistent coding convention</h2>

<p>After overcoming the mental inertia to decide on a new naming convention, actually implementing it should be the easy part. A series of <a href="http://robinlovelace.net/r/2014/04/14/regex-in-R-RStudio.html">regex</a> commands could help, including the following (the ‘Regex’ tickbox must be enabled if you’re searching in RStudio):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[a-z]\.[a-z] # will search for dots between lowercase chars (period.separation)
[a-z][A-Z] # find camelBack code
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, these commands will also find many R commands that use these naming convention, so just re-reading the code may be just as fast.</p>

<p>The below image shows the github diff of a typical change as part of a renaming strategy. Note in this example that not only are we implementing a consistent naming convention, we also added a new comment in this commit, improving the code’s ‘understandability’. Implementing a naming convention can be part of a wider campaign to improve your R projects. This could include adding comments, <a href="http://robinlovelace.net/r/2014/06/25/pruning-a-giant-gh-repo.html">removing redundant information</a> from large projects and reformatting code, perhaps using the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/formatR/index.html">formatR package</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/commit/b6729590a5c9bbf3f4e5332c46e57c732412345c"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15008199/img/r_style.png" alt="commit" /></a></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It <em>is</em> important to think about style in writing any languages, especially if your code will be <a href="http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2012-2/RJournal_2012-2_Baaaath.pdf">read by others</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What could help might be to raise awareness in the R community about naming conventions; writers of books and tutorials on R could make a difference here by treating naming conventions when introducing the R language.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, it is lazy and irresponsible to write and maintain messy code that is difficult to read. By contrast, consistent, clear and well-commented code will help you and others use your code and ensure its longevity. Adoption of a clearly defined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_%28programming%29">naming convention</a> such as the <strong>underscore_separation</strong> adopted in our <a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/raw/master/intro-spatial-rl.pdf">tutorial</a> can be an easy step one can take <em>now</em> towards this aim.</p>

<p>The only question that remains is which naming convention <code class="highlighter-rouge">WiLL.U_uSe</code>!</p>
