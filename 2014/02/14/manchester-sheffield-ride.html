    <h1 class="post-title">Sheffield to Manchester cycle</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Feb 14, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I arrived in Manchester around 2pm, having set-off from Sheffield at 9am and 
cycled all the way. 
This may sound like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism">masochistic</a> 
mid-February activity. But I can only report good vibes: a subtle rush of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins">endorphins</a> released from pushing the 
body and the satisfaction of knowing I got here with my own energies alone, 
rather than depending on <a href="http://techalive.mtu.edu/meec/module19/Page4.htm">ancient sunlight</a>
stored in fossil fuels and imported from afar.</p>

<p>The route I took was fast, fun and felt safe yet exciting. 
Having done the trip a few times before,
and feeling sure that this was the best route 
I’ve taken so far, I’m going to share
it with the world. The actual route I took was recorded by the 
GPS on my smartphone (which I uploaded to <a href="http://gpsies.com/">GPSies</a>), 
enabling it to be stored for posterity and downloaded by others for 
future reference. I wouldn’t say this is the <em>best</em> possible 
route from Sheffield to Manchester, but I would certainly recommend it to most 
cyclists, for reasons outlined below.</p>

<h2 id="deciding-the-route-in-advance">Deciding the route in advance</h2>

<p>To be honest, I didn’t put a lot of thought into planning the route 
in advance. Simply typing “Sheffield” and “Manchester” into the 
from and to fields in the open source bicycle route planner
<a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/">CycleStreets.net</a> yields 3 options, 
the fastest of which looked reasonable to me. Each of these can 
be seen on the <a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/39363548/">route’s own web page</a>, automatically generated and 
stored for posterity.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15008199/Images-2-share/shef2manc.png" alt="Route options from CycleStreets.net" /></p>

<p>As you’ll see from the <a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/39363548/">route’s page</a>, 
CycleStreets.net very handily provides turn-by-turn breakdown of the trip, including 
<a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/location/33925/">links to photos uploaded to the internet by enthusiasts</a> and sub-maps of key parts of the route, such as the one 
displayed below.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/39363548/maplet39363548fastest44075for4398.png" alt="key route part" /></p>

<p>I did also try planning the route using 
<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Sheffield,+United+Kingdom&amp;daddr=Manchester,+United+Kingdom&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.466796,-1.841583&amp;spn=0.409566,0.883026&amp;sll=53.426314,-1.86006&amp;sspn=0.409953,0.883026&amp;geocode=FQmILgMde5Hp_ykVvuj6qQp5SDF4sAav9ScoPg%3BFZwHMAMd27Dd_ynb9SZSTE16SDGqa_4EOBS-2Q&amp;oq=man&amp;dirflg=b&amp;mra=ltm&amp;t=m&amp;z=10&amp;lci=bike">Google’s bicycle route planning option</a>
and was heartened to see that, after forcing the route onto the exciting 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_Pass">Snake Pass</a> the 
<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2uwXz">result</a> was similar to the CycleStreets option:</p>

<p><img src="http://robinlovelace.net/figure/shef2mancg.png" alt="google fast route" /></p>

<p>Basically, I was happy with the distance (~40 miles), time estimated by CycleStreets (4 1/2 hours) and Google (4 1/4 hours) and was confident that I could get onto the Snake Pass without 
need for navigation. Owning a smartphone, I decided to play it by ear and wait for instructions
from CycleStreets.net or Google on how to navigate myself to Manchester city centre once in Glossop. 
As explained below, I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<h2 id="the-ride-itself">The ride itself</h2>

<p>The ride itself was fun, fast and felt safe. My friend Woody
accompanied me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladybower_Reservoir">Ladybower resevoir</a>, after which point I was on my own. 
Riding up to the summit of the Pennine Pass (1600 ft, a climb of 1300 ft from the 
starting height of 300 ft in Sheffield) was a mission, but not arduous on my
road bike, lightly loaded with a single pannier and a rucksack.</p>

<p>Before I knew it I was on the fast descent into Glossop. This made the trip worth it on 
its own, as the Snake Pass is ultra smooth and has pleasant curves around beautiful 
scenery. Having never been into Glossop centre, I stopped for a cup of tea and relax there.</p>

<p>It was raining when I left, recharged after a brew. The route planning was also more 
complicated from this point onwards, unless you are <em>really</em> in a rush in which 
case you would just continue on the A57. At this point I got my smartphone out.</p>

<p>Initially CycleStreets “live ride” journey planner was my first choice, but it crashed a 
couple of times at which point I switched to Google Maps’ navigation app. 
I wore earphones, allowing the soothing lady’s voice to tell me “turn left onto Mottram Road in 1000 ft” and other clear instructions. Obediently I followed.</p>

<p>The great thing about following route planners like 
this is that you can appear on completely unexpected paths. This happened spectacularly for me, as I was guided onto 
a canal path which is hidden from the road. This took me 5 miles all the way to my destination.</p>

<p>To re-trace this track - which I wholy recommend - you can download the GPS trace from 
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/RobinLovelace/traces/1655684">here, on Open Street Map</a>. Of course there are other route options, but I’d say that this one combines the a great combination of speed, fun and canal towpaths!</p>

<h2 id="alternative-routes-and-final-reflections">Alternative routes and final reflections</h2>

<p>I am 
by no means the first to attempt the journey, and many alternative routes are available online.
<a href="http://www.cyclesheffield.org.uk/">Cycle Sheffield</a>, for example, offers a 
<a href="http://www.cyclesheffield.org.uk/route-planning/long-distance-routes/sheffield-to-manchester/">detailed description</a>
of a 
largely rural route (see map below).</p>

<iframe src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=204112132629730101627.0004a38bf89ff2c48e1cb&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=53.390534,-1.793089&amp;spn=0.112659,0.661068&amp;output=embed" height="350" width="425" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This route avoids the busier Snake and Woodhead passes. The former 
because it is described as “narrow and has fast traffic”, the latter being “a highly undesirable place to be for a cyclist”. 
Having ridden both routes, I would say that both descriptions are a little exagerated: yes cars tend to 
whizz over the snake pass and yes there is a high proportion of trucks in the traffic in the flow over Woodhead. 
But neither felt inherently dangerous at any time: in some ways the long expanses of road space felt safer
per kilometre than urban traffic, which is far less predictable (due to cars pulling out, traffic lights, left
and right turns and other urban phonomena). Wynnat’s pass is probably the least busy option, but still requires
busy roads to get there quickly and is slightly longer than the swooping Snake Pass.</p>

<p>An even more rural route is the <a href="http://www.gps-routes.co.uk/routes/home.nsf/RoutesLinksCycle/trans-pennine-trail-walking-and-cycle-route">trans pennine trail</a>, a completely off-road trail of which Sheffield-Manchester is 
only a part: it runs from coast to coast. Again, this route is ideal for leisure purposes, but 
will be much slower than the road option I took.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great ride, even given the rain. I would fully recommend inter-city cycling to anyone - just take a day out and go for it - and with smartphones and
the recent emergence fantastic
bicycle-specific online route planners, planning and executing the journey is easier than ever before.</p>
