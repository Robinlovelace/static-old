  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The mission was to get from my current place in Leeds to my home
town of Hereford. It’s <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Leeds,+UK&amp;daddr=Hereford&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=38.554089,86.572266&amp;geocode=FTPvNAMd61zo_ymZvWTaSj55SDGp3BMC_bqtUQ%3BFU5RGgMduo7W_ylBU26qJdRvSDGWbDz9S5qc1Q&amp;t=h&amp;mra=ls&amp;z=8">178 miles by motorway</a>
and a <a href="http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/LDS/HFD/today/1045/dep">long and
pricey</a>
trip by
train. But at even at an optimistic speed of 15 mph and no stops it was even less
attractive to by bike: an impossibility in a single day. So a compromise was in order</p>
<ul>
  <li>to travel by train part of the journey and cycle the rest. That way I would
passed through a part of the world that was previously unexplored: the
Shropshire countryside.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stafford seemed like the ideal place to start: it’s far enough west to get into
the countryside and far enough north to still provide a decent ride to Hereford,
80 miles in total. Although I didn’t make it all the way to Hereford by bike (I
got lazy and jumped on a train in Ludlow), it was an enjoyable ride and a
story worth telling. Inter-city cycling is more feasible than most people think,
especially when combined with rail.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-stafford">Getting to Stafford</h2>

<p>The first stage was getting there. I was close to not even being able
to get my bike on the train and just caught the tail end of the rush hour
on the 08:55 from Leeds to Manchester. In hindsight I’d have booked through
East Coast, the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/community/how-to/bike-rail-commuting">only train ticket vendor to send bike reservations in the
pos</a>,
to ensure bike places, but fortunately I was in luck. The train out to Stafford
was more spacious and I was on the road by 11am.</p>

<h2 id="cycle-routing-options">Cycle routing options</h2>

<p>The great thing about smartphones is that they enable flexibility in route
planning. Although I had glanced at the route previously on Google Maps, on the
day I decided to try the cyclis-specific planning application
<a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/">CycleStreets.net</a>. I was really impressed with
the “fastest” route that it chose for me and, with headphones in one ear, I
could simply follow the audio instructions about the best way to get out into
Stafford. Before long I was in the countryside, flying over the fast and
comparatively empty A and B roads that
<a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/40931228/">CycleStreets.net directed me to</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15008199/img/staff2lud-cc.png" alt="staffimage" />.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the distances of routes recommended by
cyclestreets.net and Google’s bicycle routes: the former suggests routes of 45,
50 and 55 miles for the fastest, balanced and quietest <a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/help/overview/">route options,
respectively</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Stafford,+UK&amp;daddr=ludlow&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52.588032,-2.426605&amp;spn=0.463051,1.352692&amp;sll=52.587297,-2.411246&amp;sspn=0.463059,1.352692&amp;geocode=FSXEJQMdLKTf_ylffQttf4JwSDEIWNgR1bNHGw%3BFYURHwMdx5bW_ylLK1nDtxRwSDEOGXwYP9AZfA&amp;t=h&amp;dirflg=b&amp;mra=ltm&amp;z=10&amp;lci=bike">Google’s only offers one bicycle option for the same
trip</a>:
53 miles taking you way out West in quite a cirquitous route. The car route is
also unacceptable, because it favours fast roads rather than directness, with a
distance of 47 miles:</p>

<h2 id="the-low-point-of-the-journey-iron-bridge">The low-point of the journey: Iron Bridge</h2>

<p>The low-point of the journey in literal terms was the bidge at Coalport,
a quaint single lane bridge with steep roads either side:</p>

<p><img src="http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/05/08/2050843_dd4d555e.jpg" alt="bridge" />.</p>

<p>This is not the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironbridge">bridge</a> in
the aptly named neighbouring settlement of Ironbridge, but is equally
impressive. The whole thing was made from cast iron back in 1818!</p>

<h2 id="ludlow-laziness">Ludlow laziness</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the original plan was to cycle all the way
from Stafford to Hereford, ~80 miles. However, with the sun beaming and my
energy levels flaking the temptation to get on the train at Ludlow started
appealing to me. A phone call with a friend from Hereford sealed it: if I could
be back by 5:30 he’d meet me in the pub. Therefore I jumped at the opportunity,
passing through Ludlow’s historic market before getting on the train.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a really fun ride and for me highlights the benefits of mixing bicycles
with trains as a flexible, fast and fun form of transport.</p>
